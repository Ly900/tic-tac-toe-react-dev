## Tutorial Extras:

- For the current move only, show “You are at move #…” instead of a button. (Done)
- Rewrite Board to use two loops to make the squares instead of hardcoding them. (Done)
- Add a toggle button that lets you sort the moves in either ascending or descending order. (Done)
- When someone wins, highlight the three squares that caused the win (and when no one wins, display a message about the result being a draw). (Done)
- Display the location for each move in the format (row, col) in the move history list.
